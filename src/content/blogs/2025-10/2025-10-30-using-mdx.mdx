import CustomNote from "../../../../components/knowledge-card/CardFront.astro";

# Hello MDX

This is an example MDX blog post. You can use standard Markdown syntax plus JSX/MDX imports.

<CustomNote />

Here's a React-style JSX snippet (if you import a React component):

```jsx
// In MDX you can import React components then use them directly
import MyButton from "../../../components/ui/button";

<MyButton>Click me</MyButton>
```

You can also embed raw HTML:

<button onclick="alert('This is plain HTML; for interactive React components import them instead')">Plain HTML button</button>

Enjoy writing with MDX!
